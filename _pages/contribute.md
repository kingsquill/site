# How to Contribute

As a volunteer project, contributions of time are the most important. Whether you enjoy the detailed work of transcription and proofreading, the critical analysis of revision, or just want to take a minute to report a typo as you're reading, we appreciate you!

Our transcription process is [managed through GitHub](https://github.com/kingsquill/). Normally used for collaborating on code, GitHub also makes this kind of literary collaboration easy.

## Recommended Setup

We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as an editor. It's extensible and comes with first-class support for the Git workflows we use for transcription and review. When you open the repository, you'll be prompted with a few recommended extensions: `vscode-pdf` lets you open the source PDFs in an editor window, allowing for side-by-side transcription; `Insert Unicode` gives some keyboard shortcuts for special characters like `Å¿` that aren't on normal keyboards; and `Code Spell Checker` helps the revision process by highlighting some words that need to be updated.

After installing Visual Studio Code, you'll create your own [fork of the transcription repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) (e.g., [https://github.com/kingsquill/william-perkins](https://github.com/kingsquill/william-perkins)). Follow the [GitHub Flow process](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) to create a branch, commit your work, and then submit a pull request for review.

If this seems complex and intimidating, we get it. We're working on a simpler set of instructions, but in the mean time, feel free to drop into our [Discord](https://discord.gg/MVEAJMb9jD) for help getting started!
