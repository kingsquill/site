# How to Contribute

As a volunteer project, contributions of time are the most important. Whether you enjoy the detailed work of transcription and proofreading, the critical analysis of revision, or just want to take a minute to report a typo as you're reading, we appreciate you!

Our transcription process is [managed through GitHub](https://github.com/kingsquill/). Normally used for collaborating on code, GitHub also makes this kind of literary collaboration easy.

Check out our recommended setup. If you're already experienced with Git, you can use whatever tools you're comfortable with.
