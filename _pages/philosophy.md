# Publishing Philosophy

We want to give you a faithful copy of the author's works in a format you can read and understand.

Many valuable books are technically available, but are preserved as scanned images of an old book. Archaic spelling and typesetting make these hard to read, and the fixed layout of the scanned page doesn't work well on all devices.

So how do we get from those scanned images to the final version?

## Step 1: Transcription

We make an exact copy of the text - spelling, typesetting, and all. Mistakes or typos are called out in a footnote, but left exactly as we found them.

After each chapter is transcribed, it is proofread and compared with the original to fix any errors.

## Step 2. Revision

We try to keep changes to an absolute minimum. The meaning of a text can hang on something as small as a comma. So we focus on a few simple and clear-cut changes, where the meaning is unambiguous:

- Standardizing spelling.
- Standardizing typesetting (emphasis, headers) and layout.
- Standardizing punctuation.
- If there is any doubt as to the correct rendering, we'll default to the original.

## Step 3. Publishing

We release these works in a couple standard formats: PDF, epub, Kindle, HTML, and plain Markdown text. Each of these is generated automatically from the Markdown source, without manual intervention, to minimize the possibility of error.
