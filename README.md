# King's Quill site build

This is an Eleventy static site build.

## Dynamically-loaded data

The `_data/books.json` file is pulled in from the kingsquill/william-perkins repo dynamically at build time. For local development, you can copy https://read.kingsquill.org/books.json into the `_data` directory, and it will be gitignored automatically.
